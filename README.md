## *SegMatch*

*SegMatch* is a reliable loop-closure detection algorithm based on the matching of 3D segments. The *SegMatch* code is open-source (BSD License) and has been tested under Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Indigo. Please remember that this is on-going research code which is subject to changes in the future. Several new features and demonstrations will be added soon.

Please consult our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.07720v1.pdf), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iddCgYbgpjE) and [wiki](https://github.com/ethz-asl/segmatch/wiki) for the algorithm description and for instructions on running demonstrations.

### Compiling *SegMatch*
The following configuration was tested under Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS indigo. Please see the final note if you want to compile under ROS Kinetic.

First install the required system packages:
```
$ sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev python-wstool doxygen
```
Then use wstool for installing catkin dependencies:
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ wstool init
$ wstool merge segmatch/dependencies.rosinstall
$ wstool update
```
Finally build the *laser_mapper* package which will compile all *SegMatch* modules:
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCUDA_USE_STATIC_CUDA_RUNTIME=OFF laser_mapper
```
See this link for installing [catkin_tools](http://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html). Building dependencies will require some time according to which new packages need to be built (eg. Building the `pcl_catkin` package can take up to two hours). Building `pcl_catkin` might fail if you do not have sufficient RAM. It can help to add `-j2` to catkin build in order to limit the parallel jobs and reduce memory usage.

Consult the [wiki](https://github.com/ethz-asl/segmatch/wiki) for instructions on running the demonstrations.

Note: If you are using ROS Kinetic, you might want to run the following command in your catkin workspace prior to building the packages:
```
$ catkin config --merge-devel
```
